ADDING HEAD AND TITLE ON ALL PAGES

title which shows on the tab and content is the text we see when searched in search engines

import Head from 'next/head';

<Head>
    <title>All My Events</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Explore all events to know more details"/>
</Head>

and these Head tags are part of response from view page source, after adding these in any of the pages
check the page source they will be present

Within a component if the Head content is repeating wrap it in a const or let based on usage and re use it

let pageHeadData = (
    <Head>
          <title>Filtered Event</title>
          <meta
            name="description"
            content={`filtered events on ${numMonth}/${numYear}`}
          />
      </Head>
  )

  ADDING HEAD IN _app.js
  Instead of adding head info on all page components, we can also have the same meta data on pages at once by adding it in 
  _app.js file, Layout used here id used for all teh pages to have look alike same so wrap Head inside of Layout

  return <Layout>
    <Head>
          <meta
          name="viewport"
          content="initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width"
          />
      </Head>
    <Component {...pageProps} />
    </Layout>

ADDING DEFAULT META IN _app.js 

next would all the meta tags within _app.js and a specific page component, so for each component we can its own
meta but if we miss adding it in any component to have a default meta we can add it in _app.js

_document.js and USES
to configure the html doc itself lets say a lang attribute to the entire page it can be done using this file
add it in pages/ within root of pages

import Document,  { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'
class MyDocument extends Document {
    render() {
        return (
            <Html lang="en">
                <Head/>
                <body>
                    {/* Main is reponsible to render the page components and react components */}
                    <Main/> 
                    <NextScript/>
                </body>
                
            </Html>
        )
    }
}

export default MyDocument

IMAGE OPTIMIZATION USING next/image
generally using <img> tag in a normal HTML yhe image size is more and is not what we wnat in PROD
so next offers us this <Image/> from 'next/image' which will lazy load images also the size is rendered
based on which device and browser the client is fetching that image so on chrome it would be "webp" type of image
instead of "jpg" etc

Also with this if an image is already loaded, instead of fetching it again next will load it from the cache, so once we did this process
there should be "cache" folder within ".next" folder where you can see the cryptic images cached out of our component
